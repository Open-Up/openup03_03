# Practical work : CEPH

In this practical work, we will set up a CEPH cluster, and access it : 
 - via block devices
 - via filesystem

# Step 1 : Machine provisionning

First, we need to set up Virtualbox virtual machines.

 - Create 4 virtual machines from debian.ova image
 - Configure them to use the same internal network

Give tem the following names :

 - ceph-admin
 - ceph-node1
 - ceph-node2
 - ceph-node3

Add two disks of 5 GB to ceph-node*

# Step 2 : Cluster setup

Set up a SSH server on each nodes. Create a ceph user on each node. Give him sudo priviledges on each node, without to type password. Generate a SSH key on ceph-admin. Copy the key to every nodes. Enable the SSH key on any node. You should be able to login and switch of nodes without typing passwords.

Now on ceph-admin, install ceph-deploy.

```
wget -q -O- 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-dumpling/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ceph-deploy
```

Please also set up DNS resolution threw /etc/hosts to address them by there name.

# Step 3 Installing CEPH

Install CEPH packages on every host.

Create a cluster with name my-ceph-cluster.

Install two monitors : 
 - ceph-node1
 - ceph-node2

Gather monitors keys.

Install two MDS
 - ceph-node1
 - ceph-node2

Install three OSDs :
 - ceph-node1
 - ceph-node2
 - ceph-node3

Please separate journals from data storage from system instalation.

# Step 4 Create a CEPH fileSystem

Create two rados pools : 
 - cephfs-data
 - cephfs-metadata

Create a filesystem named cephfs using these pools.

Check they entered active state.

Mount the fileSystem on ceph-admin. Create files on it.

# Step 5 create Block devices

Create a rados pool volumes

Create two objects of 256MB each

Map these objects to block devices.

Format them in ext4, and use them. Create files on it.
